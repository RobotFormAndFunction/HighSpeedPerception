This folder contains the stl files for the chassis and the wheels.

The chassis (chassis.stl) and wheels (wheelmount_back.stl and wheel_mount_front.stl) are recommended to be printed on SLA printer with a hard resin. A FormLabs 3+ was used with the clear resin. The tires (wheel_tire.stl) is recommended to be printed with an elastic resin, or molded from an elastomeric material. A FormLabs 3+ was used with the elastic 50A resin. In total, one chassis is needed, two front wheels, two back wheels, and four tires.

The robot also needs two DC motors, two bearings, and carbon fiber rod to complete the build.
